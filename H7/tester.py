# Based on testing harness dated 2017-06-02.

# STUDENTS: TO USE:
# 
# The following command will test all test cases on your file:
#   
#   MAC:
#   python3 <thisfile.py> <your_one_file.py>
# 
#   PC:
#   python <thisfile.py> <your_one_file.py>
# 
# 
# You can also limit the tester to only the functions you want tested.
# Just add as many functions as you want tested on to the command line at the end.
# Example: to only run tests associated with func1 and func2, run this command:
# 
#   python3 <thisfile.py> <your_one_file.py> func1 func2
# 
# You really don't need to read the file any further, except that when
# a specific test fails, you'll get a line number - and it's certainly
# worth looking at those areas for details on what's being checked. This would
# all be the indented block of code starting with "class AllTests".


# INSTRUCTOR: TO PREPARE:
#  - add test cases to class AllTests. The test case functions' names must
# be precise - to test a function named foobar, the test must be named "test_foobar_#"
# where # may be any digits at the end, such as "test_foobar_13".
# - any extra-credit tests must be named "test_extra_credit_foobar_#"
# 
# - name all required definitions in REQUIRED_DEFNS, and all extra credit functions
#   in EXTRA_CREDIT_DEFNS. Do not include any unofficial helper functions. If you want
#   to make helper definitions to use while testing, those can also be added there for
#   clarity.
# 
# - to run on either a single file or all .py files in a folder (recursively):
#   python3 <thisfile.py> <your_one_file.py>
#   python3 <thisfile.py> <dir_of_files>
#   python3 <thisfile.py> .                    # current directory
